Title: The Case for Universal Basic Income

Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a proposed system where all citizens receive a regular, unconditional sum of money from the government. This essay argues that UBI is necessary to address the challenges of the modern economy.

First, UBI would eliminate poverty. By providing a guaranteed floor of income, no one would fall below the poverty line. This is self-evident because if everyone has money, no one is poor.

Second, automation is replacing jobs at an alarming rate. Robots will take all our jobs by 2030, leaving humans with nothing to do. Therefore, we need UBI to survive the robot apocalypse.

Critics argue that UBI would discourage work. However, these critics are just greedy capitalists who want to keep wages low. They don't care about the average person.

In conclusion, UBI is the only solution to our economic problems. We must implement it immediately or face societal collapse.
